This captivating abstract painting, reminiscent of Pablo Picasso's renowned cubist style, features a human figure with a stylized face composed of bold, curving lines and geometric shapes. The face, depicted from a three-quarter perspective with a slight tilt toward the viewer, showcases exaggerated proportions and abstracted forms, including a long, narrow nose and a thin line for a mouth. The angular structure on the head, possibly a hat or headpiece, is outlined in black with a hint of orange, suggesting a sun or circular object. Loose brushstrokes depict the hair, adding to the overall sense of distortion. The background is a soothing mix of blues and light colors, creating a dynamic contrast with the darker tones of the figure, while a small white watermark in the bottom-right corner reads "GALERIA SAVARIA" and "ANTWERPEN," subtly acknowledging the artwork's provenance. The rich palette of blues, blacks, ochre, and white lends a dramatic yet harmonious appearance to the composition.
